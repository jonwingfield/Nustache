- Handle whitespace better.
  - Strip out new lines after non-variable markers.
- Provide more implementations for locating templates.
  - From a Dictionary<string, Template>.
  - From the file system.
    - Option for multiple paths and extensions.
  - From assembly resources.
  - From other locators.
    - Caching adapter.
- {{>}} invokes parent template with same name?
- Add magic variables like {{$index}} and {{$first}}.
  - Need to work with sections, too, like {{#$first}}first stuff goes here{{/$first}}.
- Add some syntax to define "local" variables?
  - Either that or a way to evaluate variables in templates at definition time.
    - {{<foo}}{{bar!}}{{/foo}}
- Add support for variable modifiers like in ctemplate.
  - Need a way to specify custom modifiers.
- Be able to generate static code for later compilation.
  - Would be nice if it didn't use reflection.
- Also, think about dynamically generating code for immediate use. May be faster.
- Pass row/col context from scanner to parser for use in exception handling/debugging
